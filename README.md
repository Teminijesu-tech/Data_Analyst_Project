Dataset Investigation - No-show medical appointments
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

'ScheduledDay' tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
'Neighborhood' indicates the location of the hospital.
'Scholarship' indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
'Hipertension','Diabetes', 'Alcoholism', 'Handcap' are various characteristics describing the patient. 1 means the patient has that attribute while 0 means the patient does not have that attribute.
'SMS_received' indicates whether the patient recieved an SMS or not. 0 means the patient did not receive an SMS while 1 indicates the patient received an SMS.
'No-show' says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
